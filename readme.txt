Pocket OCR
Tesseract OCR for iPhone

This project is a demonstration of implementing the Tesseract OCR engine on the iPhone platform. It works best with the iPhone 3GS and it's autofocus lens. External lenses for older iPhones may be necessary for optimal image capture.

To build the tesseract library, download the source code and compile apropriately for the iPhone (arm processor). Add the library to the XCode project and build.

The Tesseract source code is available at:
http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

A build script and instructions are available at:

Issue tracker now available at http://bugs.robertcarlsen.net/projects/pocket-ocr-200.
